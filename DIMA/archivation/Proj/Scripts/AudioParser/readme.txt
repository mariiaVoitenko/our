*** Description ***

============================

I tried to implement the algorithm of the game AudioSurf. The whole procedure of obtaining the road described in the tutorial from badlogicgames, but I added a few modifications (Kalman filter, beat detector, auto compute threshold window size). An algorithm allows to analyze audio data portions, showing the current progress analysis. 

Features of the algorithm:
* Beat & onset detector
* Flux sound wave generator
* Super fast fft algotitm by Gerald T. Beauregard
* Full documented and clean source code included
